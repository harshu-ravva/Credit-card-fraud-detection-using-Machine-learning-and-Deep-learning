# Credit-card-fraud-detection-using-Machine-learning-and-Deep-learning
Online shoppers prefer using credit cards because of their speed and convenience, but the rise in credit card users has also increased the risk of fraud. This study aims to detect scams that exploit public data, imbalanced data, changing fraud types, and high false alarm rates. Various machine learning algorithms like Extreme Learning Method, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and XG Boost have been used, but newer deep learning algorithms are needed to better combat fraud. By comparing machine learning and deep learning techniques on a dataset of European credit card fraud, researchers found that using convolutional neural networks with more layers improved fraud detection accuracy. The proposed approach achieved high accuracy, f1-score, precision, and AUC Curves, outperforming current methods. The study also explored data adjustments and deep learning to reduce false negatives and showed promising results for detecting credit card fraud in real-world scenarios.
